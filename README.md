# AbdullahiM28.github.io
Hello! 
Im Abdullahi and this repository is my journey in learning how to create my own personal website. 
It's gonna look like garbage at the start, but I will improve it as I learn more about HTML/CSS, and javascript.
Eventually, I will have a clean and professional website that will display my skills, background, and experience.
